# Avanti
Avanti eases the way of deploying new virual hosts on a (currently we only support Ubuntu 16.04 ðŸ˜‹) machine.

The goal is to have an [FastCGI Pool Manager (**FPM**)](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) to controll all domains.

Domains get assigned a pool of PHP processes that they can spawn.

## development
